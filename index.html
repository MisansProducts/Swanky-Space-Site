							The game, Swanky Space, is a 2-dimensional space shooter created by Alex Akoopie in 2016.
							It is similar to the game
							<a target = "_blank" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)">Asteroids</a>
							in that the player is controlling a spaceship which appears to manifest a triangle.
							The player eliminates asteroids and other objects to gain score and money (Swanky Credits) in order to
							purchase upgrades for their spaceship and progress the game. The goal of Swanky Space is to reach the
							end of the game whilst the player utilizes all the skills they have learned along way.
							In other words, shoot things before they kill you!</p>

								Tyler says, <i>"Hey. The name's Tyler. This is sorta my website. Kinda cool, huh? My own
								freakin' website! Aww yeah."</i>
								<br><br>
								This man is a very accomplished individual. After years of developing music, he developed a knack for
								music theory and passed down his talents to his colleagues. Tyler has refined
								his senses over the past decade. For example, he has mastered many different genres of music and can
								display exhilarating vocal performances. Most of his work is done using digital audio
								workstations. Beyond his natural adequacy with unfamiliar generators and plugins, his
								mixing is what sets him apart from the mainstream. Beautifully mastered audio in just under a few hours. Most
								of Tyler's work is coming up with new ideas because he works so efficiently. This is his weakness, as it forces him to
								doubt most of his tracks, causing them to never reach the public. Even then, Tyler has
								a lot of things to bring to the table.
								<br><br>
								Growing up, Tyler made his own scripts for his conveniences, dissected computer hardware,
								and drew immersive artwork. Tyler's creativity is one of his strongest skills in his possession.
								Take this website for example. While Alex has incorporated the design into this website,
								it was Tyler that envisioned every little detail. From the gradience, to the parallax, and even focusing on
								the pixels between vertically aligned elements.

								Alex says, <i>"Hello. How can I help you?"</i>
								<br><br>
								When Alex was young his brother gifted him a laptop. With it, he made many memories playing video games and watching videos
								on cold winter nights. His brother suggested him to learn how to code, starting with the Python language. However,
								Alex only grew an interest after his friend Tyler showed him that he could make a text-based adventure game by
								using Batch on the Windows operating system. He made his first video game ever, <i>Swanky Rebels</i>.
								<br><br>
								Alex also started to work on modding existing video games, making maps, plugins, and other assets for people to enjoy.
								Most of his creations had the word "Swanky" in the name. That word described everything he made; his games were odd and unique,
								but rich in effort.
								<br><br>
								Holding onto the "Swanky" ideas, Alex finally decided to make a full-fledged game. On May third, 2016, Swanky Space was
								made under his alias, Abacus Paradox. Since then, it has come a long way.
								<br><br>
								While not as serious as Tyler, Alex does make music as a hobby to improve upon his past and reflect how he is feeling.
								<br><br>
								Alex has also made many different programs and learned a variety of languages. The two most prominent projects he has
								developed were Alex Bot - a Discord bot for his Discord server - and his personal webpage after learning HTML5, CSS,
								and JavaScript.
								<br><br>
								Overall, Alex continues to improve and impress for days to come.
